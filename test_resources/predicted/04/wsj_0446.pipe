Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.It is time-consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots to ease them through).Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. Timing is of the essence with RU-486.It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective.That is typically about a three-week window. So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is "safe." But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means "there's been no evidence so far of mortality." No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman's health or fertility. The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.But there are no scientific data on this question. Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported in 1987.However, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the French physician who invented RU-486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys.The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it|Inh|Null|Null|Null|||||||||
