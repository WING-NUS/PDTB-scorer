Cap added four more divisions to the Army, two active and two reserve; two carrier groups to the Navy; a division -- equivalent to the Marines; and the C-5B, KC-10, C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force.He bought $4 billion in prepositioning ships and $7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them, and parked them at a new $6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean.He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf. One night both Marshall's ghost and the shah's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground.Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command.He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole Navy.They had fun moving the carriers around, but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers.But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap, so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $7 billion of loading barges, ramps, etc., in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains. Then suddenly Ike's ghost came to visit and said, "What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away?We'd get our asses kicked." Lucky for Cap, Ike was easygoing and soon went away, while the shah -- he kept coming back.So the U.S. found itself paying about $2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean. We had great success in Somalia.But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf. (But who's counting.) Still, Berbera was the best we could get, so we stay in bed with President Barrah.All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway|||
