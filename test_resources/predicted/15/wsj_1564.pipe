Risk is also a function of time. When financial professionals measure risk mathematically, they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns.Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills, for example, because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider.That is usually measured by the standard deviation, or divergence, of annual results from the average return over time. But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals. For instance, some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash; last Friday's debacle only reinforced those feelings.But the stock market, despite some stomach-churning declines, has far outperformed other securities over extended periods. By retreating to the apparent security of, say, money-market funds, investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement. "That's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives," says Steven B. Enright, a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services|||
